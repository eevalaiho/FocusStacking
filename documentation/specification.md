## Focal stack compositing for depth of field control

Many cameras provide insufficient control over depth of field. Some have a fixed aperture; others have a variable aperture that is either too small or too large to produce the desired amount of blur. To overcome this limitation, one can capture a focal stack, which is a collection of images each focused at a different depth, then combine these slices to form a single composite that exhibits the desired depth of field.
