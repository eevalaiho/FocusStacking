JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API) has classes DFTDescriptor and IDFTDescriptor which seem to match.

* API docs for DFTDescriptor describe it as follows:

    The "DFT" operation computes the discrete Fourier transform of an image.

* for inverse transform, there is IDFTDescriptor:

    The "IDFT" operation computes the inverse discrete Fourier transform of an image.
