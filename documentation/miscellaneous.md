## Fourier transform

## Princeton FFT.java

[FFT.java.html](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/97data/FFT.java.html): Compute the FFT and inverse FFT of a length n complex sequence using the radix 2 Cooley-Tukey algorithm.

### OpenCV Java tutorials

[Fourier tranform tutorial](https://opencv-java-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/05-fourier-transform.html): In this tutorial we are going to create a JavaFX application where we can load a picture from our file system and apply to it the DFT and the inverse DFT.

### JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API)

JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API) has classes DFTDescriptor and IDFTDescriptor which seem to match.

* API docs for DFTDescriptor describe it as follows:

    The "DFT" operation computes the discrete Fourier transform of an image.

* for inverse transform, there is IDFTDescriptor:

    The "IDFT" operation computes the inverse discrete Fourier transform of an image.
